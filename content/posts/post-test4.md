## Introduction

This is the beginning of my journey. Building a blog from scratch feels incredibly empowering. Instead of grabbing a pre-made theme, I decided to build one myself using **Hugo** and **Tailwind CSS**.

### Why this stack?

* **Speed**: Hugo is renowned for its build speed.
* **Flexibility**: Tailwind provides full control over the design without writing custom CSS.
* **Simplicity**: Markdown for content, Go templates for structure. It's a clean separation of concerns.

Here is a code block to see how the `prose` styling handles it:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Hugo!")
}
